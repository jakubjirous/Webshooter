This master thesis deals with the creation of an application for rendering websites with more rendering engines of web browsers. The goal is to create an online application that will be able to~render any web page into graphic files.

Rendering can be parameterized based on a wide range of input devices resolution, rendering engine options, destination URL and output image format.

The screenshot you create can be compared to one another in the application, both in a one-time and adjustable schedule. The result of the comparison can be modified depending on the change of predefined criteria. All outputs from the application are stored in history or downloaded directly.

The result of the work is an application that allows developers or users to easily test websites, including automatically creating and comparing images.
